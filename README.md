##The Tree of all Trades

Azadirachta indica or neem has historically provided many people, animals, and surrounding plants with a wide range of support and benefits. Whether it’s offering cooling shade, warding off pests, healing you, or filling your belly, neem effortlessly does it all. The plant is so beloved and celebrated by many that the United Nations gave it the designation of “Tree of the 21st century”. This was also echoed in a report by the United States’ National Academy of Science, which referred to Neem as a “tree for solving global problems”, alluding to its multitude of applications. 

##Botanical details

Neem is a rapidly growing, medium-sized tree which can usually reach up 15 to 20 meters tall. However, in ideal conditions, it is possible for the tree to grow up to 30 to 35 meters. Its profile is characterised by a dense, leafy, rounded canopy. These canopies are incredibly beneficial for the forest ecosystems in which it grows because their structure provides exceptional canopy protection for other organisms and the environments they are embedded in. This means that the trees’ crowns, or branches and leaves which protrude from the main trunk, easily interconnect together.  As a result, neem provides consistent cooling-shade, which helps protect and maintain soil health by combating soil erosion and the damaging impacts of harsh direct sunlight. A free-standing neem tree can provide ovular shade coverage with a possible diameter of 15 to 20 meters. While it is typically an evergreen tree, extreme conditions and circumstances, such as prolonged drought, may cause extensive leaf fall and shedding – a possible concern for cultivation, as climate change impacts increase instances of extreme weather events.

Its bark has a grooved texture, which may range from deeply fissured to scaly, depending on conditions. Typically, the outer bark’s colour is a pale-grey brown while in contrast, the heartwood has a reddish tinge. The sap is colourless, with a sticky texture, and noticeably pungent aroma. 

Neem leaves are a glossy green, and tend to crowd together at the ends of branches. These leaves are unpaired pinnates, which compound, meaning that they connect across both sides of the leaf’s stalk. At a glance, the leaves may resemble quills of feathers. 

##Growth and Dispersion

While the exact native range of the species is debated, it is thought to be native to the Indian Sub-continent and Southeast Asia. According to Kew Gardens, the native range for neem is Assam to Indo-China which includes Assam, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. The dispersion of neem has been widely facilitated through various introductions, namely in arid tropical and subtropical areas around the world. In the table below, we have provided a summary of places neem has been documented as being introduced, namely: Andaman Island, Aruba, Burkina, Cameroon, Central African Repu, Chad, Cuba, Dominican Republic, East Himalaya, Ecuador, El Salvador, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Hawaii, India, Iran, Jamaica, Jawa, Kenya, Laccadive Island, Leeward Island, Lesser Sunda Island, Malaya, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico Northwest, Nepal, Netherlands Antilles, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Rwanda, Réunion, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sumatera, Tanzania, Togo, Trinidad-Tobago, Uganda, and Windward Island. 


##Naming the Neem

As a result of its global impact and dispersion, many languages have their own specific names – some examples are listed below – please note that there are many more. In Cambodia, neem is widely called ស្តៅ or “Sdao”. This overlap and sharing of linguistic legacy is evident in the the latinised scientific name Azadirachta indica, as it is derived from the Persian one, چریش (Azad-dirakht-i-hindi). When broken down, “Azad” can be translated to “free”, “dirakht” means “tree”, and “i-Hind” refers to “of Indian Origin”.

In a similar vein, neem also has several scientific synonyms – 13 to be exact. Its homotypic synonym is Melia indica (A. Juss.) Brandis. Comparatively, it has many more heterotypic synonyms which include: Antelaea azadirachta  (L.) Adelb., Anelaea canescens Cels ex Heynh., Antelaea javanica Gaertn., Azadirachta indica var. Minor Valeton., Azadirachta indica var siamensis Valeton., Azadirachta indica subsp. Vartakii Kothari, Londhe & N.P. Singh, Melia azadirachta L., Melia fraxinifolia Salisb., Melia hasskarlii K.Koch, Melia japonica Hassk., Melia parviflora Moon, and Melia pinnata Stokes. No matter what name you may be using, one thing is clear: it is a widely known and beloved plant.

##Global Movements

Due to its wide variety of uses, it’s no shock that neem has made its way swiftly around the globe. Such versatility has led to different waves of trades and exchanges, not only among merchants, but also between immigrant populations and the communities they move and inevitably become a part, whether by choice or coercion. Though we like to think that plants, with all of their methods of movement spread on their own, humans have a great role to play in their dispersion – whether we are aware of it or not. Some might have brought neem across the oceans to share and enjoy in their new surroundings, while others may have been forced to manage the natural resources of their colonial masters.

Indian immigrants are credited for with introducing neem to Mauritius, and given this proximity, perhaps also to continental Africa. From this, additional trades and movements lead to the growth and cultivation of neem into the African landscape. Despite its “recent” introduction to the landscape, neem trees are found in the drier, low-lying areas of Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Chad, Cameroon, Togo, Nigeria, Niger, Benin, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Guinea, The Gambia, Senegal, and Mauritania.

Countries have their own individual histories of introduction. In Sudan, the first neem trees were planted in Shmbat around 1916 – it has been speculated that they were brought directly from India by a colonial forester – thought it is unclear exactly who that was. For example in Ghana, the then governor of the “Gold Coast” Brigadier-General Sir Frederick G. Guggisberg was credited for introducing the neem seeds and seedlings from India between 1919 to 1927 to the northern regions of the country. Guggisberg’s influence is demonstrated in two local names for the plant. In Ghana the tree is referred to as “king” which is the local title for governors, alluding to the connection of Guggisberg’s involvement with the plant. In contrast, within Mali, the local name within the Dyula language is “goo-gay” which is believed to be derived and warped from the name “Guggisberg”. Neem was introduced to appeared in Nigeria in 1928, likely  arguably from neighboring Ghana. Seedlings were integrated into plantation settings environments and combined alongside indigenous native plants vegetation and crops, and thriving remarkably wellprospered accordingly. To this day, there are substantial amounts of neem plantations dedicated to generating firewood and building materials in the north of Nigeria. For Senegal, there is uncertainty who may be credited with neem’s introduction to the country. However, it should be noted that in the 1950s, Senegalese agronomist Dijbirl Sene traveled to India to specifically gather neem seeds. 



##A Historical Helper

As previously mentioned, neem’s morphological structure allows it to be a very effective shade providing tree. Due to this, neem trees find themselves regularly incorporated into urban and landscape designing projects and initiatives. These can range from attempts to prevent desertification along paved roadsides to providing ample shade in public spaces. For example, in Saudi Arabia, over 50,000 neem trees have been planted around to alleviate heat concerns among Muslim pilgrims, who must camp near Mount Afarat, as part of their Hajj rites on their journey towards Mecca. The Senegalese city of Thiès, 95 percent of the trees within the urban limits are neem trees, demonstrating the effective hold that the plant has on the sector of urban forestry. 

Neem has also been planted to promote reforestation in at-risk areas, as it protects against soil erosion and improving soil quality through its nutrition-rich seedcake acting as a fertiliser. As the tree grows, it helps reduce siltation and soil acidity. As a result, it has been widely praised in the African Sahel and Haiti, for helping bolster and maintain the health and welfare of these countries’ respective ecosystems. As forester Jean Gorse reflects in relation to the Sahel, “The propagation of neem in West Africa in the '50s and '60s must be considered as the most successful (and cheapest) rural forestry operation ever implemented in this region.”

In the Indian village of Shapar, architects have designed a primary school aptly named “School Under A Neem” which incorporates local neem trees into its design and mission. The school builds upon a supposed Indian learning tradition of sitting under a tree, which has since been taken upon as a model by a couple of local Indian NGOs, as a means of providing under-privileged students living in slums accessible primary education. 


##The Joys of Eating Neem 

Neem is widely eaten across the world, with many preparations experimenting with its distinct bitter taste. The parts which are eaten include but are not limited to the leaves, flowers, and fruits.

In Cambodia, there are several dishes which feature either the leaves, flowers, or both. First, it is typically included in mahope on louh, which is the accompanying garnish tray of fresh herbs and raw vegetables that characterises many dishes within Cambodian and Khmer cuisines. For mahope on louh, both the leaves and flowers are consumed after they are carefully trimmed and cleaned. While this garnish dish is primarily raw, some people boil the neem in order to reduce its bitterness when eating it with other dishes or improve food hygiene, as chemical pesticide use in Cambodia is common. The bitter taste of the neem combats the pungent saltiness of common Khmer dishes like prahok, a fermented fish paste which is a staple ingredient in cooking and eating. In the recipe Tuk Kroeng Sdao, smashed aromatics, palm sugar, tamarind, lime juice, fish sauce, and roasted peanuts are combined with prahok to create a dipping sauce for enjoying neem leaves and flowers. In practice, the dish also accompanies a grilled freshwater fish and heaps of steamed jasmine rice, as is customary within Cambodian cuisine.

Neem also makes a regular appearance across different types of Cambodian salads, each with names referencing it accordingly. One dish is nhoam sdao (Cambodian Neem Salad) which often includes fresh neem leaves, neem flowers, bird eye’s chilis, peanuts, prahok (steamed), sliced cucumbers, and a protein of choice, all combined with tangy notes of tamarind. While there are many variations of nhoam sdao, the most commonly found protein used in recipes is slices of fatty pork belly – this is then followed by a grilled freshwater fish, usually with white flesh. This recipe is similar to the Vietnamese dish “Goi sau dau” from An Giang province, which also includes pork belly, shrimp, choke fish, cucumbers, and slices of fresh mango which are mixed together with aromatic herbs. While some sources consider this dish to be a heritage dish of An Giang, trade and cultural exchanges along the Mekong delta throughout history demonstrate the impact of how far a delicious recipe can travel.

In Thailand, neem leaves and flowers are eaten either raw or blanched with a spicy paste called น้ำพริก (Nam Phrik) made with various dried chilis, shallots, garlic, either fermented shrimp or fish paste, and squeezes of lime juice. Depending on the preparation, the consistency of the dish ranges from liquid to granular, each with their own unique spin to complement the bitter taste of neem. Nam Phrik similarly acts as an accompanying dipping sauce or condiment, liken to Cambodian prahok, within mealtimes. 

In India, neem leaves are prepared as chutney, pickles, and added to stews, soups, and rice dishes to increase their nutritional value and provide a unique flavour profile. The neem flowers are steeped and consumed as a tea, which has a reputation for being refreshing. There are also several neem beverages in India, for example neem juice and neem sherbet. To balance out the bitterness, both beverages rely on other strong tasting ingredients like sugar, honey, and tamarind. Both neem juice and neem sherbet are popular during the hotter months, as they have a cooling effect – sip by sip. 

In Thiès, Senegal, the city government allows residents to regularly forage and eat the neem fruits which grow abundantly. This provides the city’s community and lucky visitors with a stable source of food whenever they may need it. 


##Plant Panacea?

Neem has been often referred to as a ‘plant panacea’ or ‘the village pharmacy’ because of its many therapeutic capabilities and effects. Additional nicknames for neem include “the village pharmacy” or “divine tree”, which demonstrate the extent to which it is perceived as a miraculous cure-all medicinal plant in several communities and cultures in which it is used. It is considered a staple in Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine (TCAM) systems such as Ayurveda, Unani, Homoeopathy, and beyond. In Cambodia, neem is used extensively within the indigenous Traditional Khmer Medicine (TKM) system, as well as in other non-indigenous traditional medical systems practiced in-country. Presently, more than 140 different compounds have been isolated from different parts of the plant. Such insights are unsurprising once you consider that the entirety of the plant has been used across traditional medicinal regimens and treatment methods – from flower and seed, to bark and beyond.  Substantial amounts of biomedical research have demonstrated that the plant possesses anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-cariogenic, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycaemic, antiulcer, antimalarial, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. For these reasons, neem and its derived extracts, have been used to prevent, manage, and treat a wide array of diseases and conditions with differing levels of urgency and severity. From preventing malaria-ridden mosquito bites and dental decay to avoiding cardiac events and fighting cancer, neem provides users with an accessible way to manage their health issues on their own terms. Smallpox? No problem for neem! In fact, within the Ayurvedic medicine, it is encouraged to consume neem on a daily basis as a prophylaxis – with each leaf, or other part of the plant, believed to ensure and maintain health.

In Cambodia, neem is often prepared as a decoction with hot water to prevent and treat malaria. During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers across the globe speculated on neem’s therapeutic effects as being a form of prophylactic and/ or treatment for the disease. Whether as part of a capsule, or as a formulation of water, acetone, and extracts from its leaves, researchers conservatively argued that neem possessed qualities which would reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among those consuming it. Some reasons cited for this possibility linked neem’s  potential to prevent or displace the binding of the COVID-19 virus to the vascular endothelium, which protectively coat our blood cells and lymphatic vessels. Considering these insights, the traditional tagline of neem being able to “bring good health” doesn’t seem so hyperbolic. It’s important to remember that even the most historically abundant and widespread plant medicines have a wide range in regards to currently documented and future novel health challenges.

However, similar to any medicine, there are limits to the therapeutic and healing effects of neem, as some dosages of the plant’s derivatives may be toxic. In the case of neem oil, which is one of the most widely utilised forms of neem derivatives, poisoning may occasionally occur. While neem oil poisoning is more common among children, there have also been isolated adult cases as well. Neem poisoning can cause vomiting, seizures, metabolic acidosis, and toxic encephalopathy. Furthermore, additional research has demonstrated that other kinds of neem extracts may also be hazardous, and that they could lead to damaging effects on the liver and kidneys. Since the rules and regulations around plant medicines vary around the world, further research must be done to demarcate collective standards for possible toxicity. If you are considering consuming or using neem for its documented medicinal qualities, as always, consult with your doctor to decide the best course of treatment to meet your needs.




##Arts, Culture, and Beyond

Neem holds exceptional cultural significance in India, where it appears in epic stories, religious ceremonies, and as part of cultural practices. At times, they are also believed to embody religious deities and represent ethical ideals. While it is easy to assume that all neem trees are sacred and important, much attention is paid to those specifically growing near or within areas of worship such as nearby temples. In Indian folklore and mythology contain several references to neem. First, the neem plant is associated with Surya, the Sun Shiva. This is due to a story where, in attempts to hide from demons chasing him, he took refuge in the tree. Another deity, the Goddess Durga (also called Shitala), is associated with neem. Worshippers of the Goddess Durga often wrap neem tree trunks with ornate pieces of fabric and adorn it with facemasks, in an attempt to personify her further and allow for more intimate connections. Neem is also planted around or incorporated into religious deities and related sculptures; at times, you can find stone snakes carefully crafted around them, demonstrating a mutualistic relationship between the natural and divine. 

There are also stories which describe how the neem plant obtained its helpful, healing, properties. It is believed that Indra, King of the Skies, was returning to his palace in paradise while holding a golden vase full of an ambrosia elixir when he spilled some on the neem tree, thus causing it to garner several therapeutic properties. 

The neem plant is also used in various ceremonies as a symbol of good luck and auspiciousness. For example, in the Maharashtra region, matrimonial rituals take place under a neem tree over the course of a week. Typically on the first day of the Hindu New Year calendar, which falls between the months of March and April, neem leaves and flowers are roasted and eaten to symbolise the acceptance of the balancing of the “good” and “bad”. Also, as part of funerary practices, neem leaves are eaten afterwards to ward off any bad spirits perceived to be lingering around. 
 
Neem flowers are also regularly a part of 24-type floral bouquets, which are often prepared to garner good luck before long travels and new business ventures. In juice form, it is used as a beverage offering to cattle among the Ganit religious sect of Gujurat. Lastly, neem wood is exclusively used to carve imagery of deities in temples within Jagannath, located in the eastern coastal city of Puri, India every 12 to 13 years.

In Tamil Nadu in the south of India, neem trees participate in ceremonial tree marriages, as they are believed to embody deities and have their own personage. Neem trees are often married to Pipal (Ficus religiosa) trees – with neem trees being perceived as an embodiment of the divine feminine and the pipal linked to the embodiment of divine masculinity.

##Biopiracy

Across the years, several attempts have been made by various companies to patent the neem plant in multiple ways around the world. These include patents focused on specific parts of the plant, its applications, products derived from the plant, or even related processes. Currently, the top five countries in the world which hold patents relating to neem are (1) The United States with 54 patents, (2) Japan with 35 patents, (3) Australia with 23 patents, and India with 14 patents. However, it should be noted that India has approximately 53 ongoing patent applications, and in the event of their collective granting, the country will hold the global record for most patents relating to neem. 

For this reason, the case of neem is often cited as a pivotal moment for the discourse on biopiracy, when a U.S. company called W.R. Grace & Co. holding a patent relating to a neem formulation, clashed with Indian company AgriDyne over the rights of usage. The term “biopiracy” refers to the “appropriation of the knowledge and genetic resources of farming and Indigenous communities by individuals that seek exclusive monopoly control (e.g. patents and or intellectual property) over these resources and knowledge”. Simply, it’s the commodification of well-known, traditional knowledge of the natural world, typically held by Indigenous groups, with no acknowledgement nor compensation. These tensions had global implications, including the annulment of a European Union based patent on a neem formulation as an anti-fungicide, showcasing the complexities of navigating the legalities of biotechnological innovations and advancements drawn from traditional ecological knowledge.


##Growing Your Own
Given its global success, growing neem isn’t as difficult as one might think. Ideally, tropical conditions and sustained access to sunlight are favorable. Seeds should be taken from overripe fruits and sown as soon as possible. While it is possible to raise seedlings in a nursery setting, planting directly has been noted to yield more success. Neem may be planted within a wide range of soil compositions such as well-drained sandy soils, silty or micaceous loams, and silty clays. The young plants grow quite rapidly, about 2 to 3 centimeters of girth a year at least, and so enthusiastically that they might push and displace the roots of other nearby plants – so carefully consider your placement. 

It is remarkably resilient to environmental changes; while young seedlings may succumb to fire, mature trees quickly regenerate from even severe damage, simply by pruning away destroyed parts. Despite this, they are not great candidates for areas with heavy winds and storms, as they are relatively brittle and parts snap off easily. Luckily, because of its bitter taste, foraging wild animals nor livestock graze upon them. 

Neem is a natural ally for both plants and people, acting as a potent pesticide thanks to its seed’s active compounds. This versatile tree thrives as protective force in any environment. In the Agri-Tech Centre, it is regularly used as part of the pest management strategies, offering a chemical-free approach that aligns with sustainable and agroecological farming principles, fostering healthier communities and ecosystems.
